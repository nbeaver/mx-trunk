The version of 'mxupdate' in this directory is the version from MX 1.1 and
before.  If you are not ready to convert your 'mxupdate.dat' file from the
old version's file format to the new file format, overwrite the 'mxupdate'
binary in your $MXDIR/sbin directory with the one from the 'update_old'
directory.  Please note that this old version of 'mxupdate' will be deleted
in the next release.
