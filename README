                            by William M. Lavender

MX is a data acquisition and control system that is designed to serve
several functions:

    o As a portable toolkit for writing data acquisition and control programs.

    o As a standalone system capable of controlling entire experiments.

    o As a platform for building device control servers to be used by other
      applications.

    o As a way of extending other control systems and of glueing disparate
      control systems together.

MX has been developed primarily for use in the X-ray and synchrotron radiation
field, but may be useful for other types of experiments.
