This directory is for miscellaneous files that do not fit anywhere else.
So far it includes:

  linux_mvme162/ - A 16 MByte MVME162 running Linux does not have enough
	memory to successfully link the default version of libMx.so.
	This directory contains alternate versions of libMx/Makefile,
	libMx/Makehead.linux and libMx/mx_driver.c for building a version
	of libMx.so with only a subset of the normal set of drivers.
