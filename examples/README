                    Example Application Programs for MX

                           by William Lavender


This package contains a set of four example application programs for MX.  Two
of the examples are written in C and the other two are written in Tcl.

To build the C examples, edit the file 'Makefile' to change the variable MXDIR
so that it points to the installed location of MX, and then type 'make' at
a shell prompt.  You will then have two executable programs named 'example1'
and 'example2'.

To run the Tcl examples, you must change the line near the top of each file
that starts with 'set mxdir' to point to the installed location of MX.

The example applications are designed to use one of two provided MX databases.
The first database 'example_soft.dat' uses only software emulated devices.
The second database 'example_net.dat' uses motors controlled by an MX server.
Copy or symbolically link one of these files to the name 'example.dat'.

example1.c
	This C program is an example of how to initialize MX and then perform
	simple motor, scaler, and timer operations.  These operations are used
	to implement a simple step scan.

example1.tcl
	This is a version of example1 that is written in Tcl.

example2.c
	This C program implements a step scan by creating an MX scan record
	and then executing the scan.  Using an MX scan record automatically
	arranges for a graphical scan progress display to be displayed and
	for the data to be recorded to a data file.

example2.tcl
	This is a version of example2 that is written in Tcl.

Please note that the Tcl examples are run using a 'wish' style binary which
requires a connection to an X server on Unix machines even though no windows
are opened.  At some point the author will provide a 'tclsh' style binary for 
MX Tcl that will lift this restriction.
