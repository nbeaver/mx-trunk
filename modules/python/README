This MX extension provides a plugin that allows C-based MX programs like
mxmotor, mxserver, etc. to use Python as a macro language.  Python scripts
are invoked using a function signature like this:

    def main( mx_database, argv ):
	# Python statements ...

WARNING: You must build the Mp Python module _BEFORE_ you attempt to build
         this extension.  If you attempt to build the 'python' extension
         before the Mp module is built, the build will fail.

Another WARNING: This extension is nowhere near ready to be used.  Do not be
         surprised when you discover that it does not work.
